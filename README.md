About Spot Instances
Amazon EC2 Spot Instances offer spare compute capacity available in the AWS cloud at steep discounts compared to On-Demand instances. Spot Instances enable you to optimize your costs on the AWS cloud and scale your application’s throughput up to 10X for the same budget.

Spot Instances can be interrupted by EC2 with two minutes of notification when EC2 needs the capacity back. You can use Spot Instances for various fault-tolerant and flexible applications, such as big data, containerized workloads, high-performance computing (HPC), stateless web servers, rendering, CI/CD and other test & development workloads.

  Karpenter: Amazon EKS Best Practice and Cloud Cost Optimization  

![Karptneter-small](https://github.com/yashdeored/ec2spotinstances/assets/152061059/64b4726a-dd71-4fa6-a387-4df148e25e02)

In this workshop, you will learn how to provision, manage, and maintain your Kubernetes clusters with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS ) scaling optimally using Karpenter . Karpenter is a node lifecycle management solution used to scale your Kubernetes cluster. Karpenter observes incoming pods and launches the right-sized Amazon EC2 Instance appropriately for the workload. Instance selection decisions are intent based and driven by the specification of incoming pods, including resource requests and scheduling constraints.
